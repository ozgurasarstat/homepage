      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently an assistant professor at the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, Acıbadem Mehmet Ali Aydınlar University, in İstanbul, Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received my PhD in Statistics and Epidemiology from Lancaster University in August 2015. Prof. Peter Diggle was my PhD advisor. Upon completing my PhD studies, I worked as a post-doctoral research associate with Prof. Peter Diggle on a number of collaborative projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current research interests centre around developing statistical and learning methods and software for forecasting problems in personalised health, business and economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important note 1: Students with strong background in statistics, mathematics, epidemiology or a related field are welcome for doing post-graduate studies under my supervision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important note 2: Scientists who have interesting research problems and interesting data are welcome to contact me for possible collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
