I am currently an assistant professor at the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, Acıbadem Mehmet Ali Aydınlar University, in İstanbul, Turkey.

I received my PhD in Statistics and Epidemiology from Lancaster University in August 2015. Prof. Peter Diggle was my PhD advisor. Upon completing my PhD studies, I worked as a post-doctoral research associate with Prof. Peter Diggle on a number of collaborative projects.

My current research interests centre around developing statistical and learning methods and software for forecasting problems in personalised health, business and economics.

Important note 1: Students with strong background in statistics, mathematics, epidemiology or a related field are welcome for doing post-graduate studies under my supervision.

Important note 2: Scientists who have interesting research problems and interesting data are welcome to contact me for possible collaboration.
