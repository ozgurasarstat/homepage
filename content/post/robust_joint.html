<h2>Robust Joint Modelling Framework</h2>
<p>Joint modelling of longitudinal time-to-event outcomes typically
combines a linear mixed-effects model and a Cox model <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/44/1/334/657852">Asar et al.(2015)</a>.
Typical distributional assumption is that random-effects and
measurement error term in mixed-effects model are Gaussian.
However, this assumption might not be optimal for real-life
problems where it is quite likely to have subjects who do not
conform the population averaged trends (they are examples of
outliers in the random-effects), and subjects who has a few
observations that are quite different compared to the rest
of the observations for subjects’ own collection of measurements
(they are examples of outliers in the measurement error).<br />
Gaussian distribution woud not give appropriate weights to the outliers,
hence inference might be biased and inefficient, and predictions might be
misleading. A natural approach would be to replace the Gaussian assumption
with t distribution. Technical details of non-Gaussian joint modelling is
skipped here, an interested reader is referred to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00816">Asar, Fournier and Dantan</a>. Below, we describe the
R package <a href="https://github.com/ozgurasarstat/robjm">robjm</a> to fit the
joint models with Gaussian and t distributed random-effects and subsequently
to obtain dynamic predictions.</p>
