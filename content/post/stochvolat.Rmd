## Robust Joint Modelling Framework

Joint modelling of longitudinal time-to-event outcomes typically 
combines a linear mixed-effects model for repeated measures 
and a Cox model with time-varying frailty for time-to-event outcome ([Asar et al., 2015](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/44/1/334/657852)). 
Typical distributional assumption is that random-effects and 
measurement error terms in mixed-effects model are Gaussian. 
However, this assumption might be restricive for real-life 
problems, where it is quite likely to have
